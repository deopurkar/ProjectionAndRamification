  We study ramification divisors of projections of a smooth projective variety onto a linear space of the same dimension.
  We prove that for a large class of varieties, the map that sends a projection to its ramification divisor is generically finite.
  By a degeneration argument involving limit linear series on vector bundles, we show that this map is also dominant for most (but not all!) varieties of minimal degree.
