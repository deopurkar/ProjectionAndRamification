1. Made the introduction much leaner.
   - Cut the first paragraph to arrive immediately at the main problem.
   - Cut the extended discussion of the enumerative problem of the degree.
     Instead, gave a short summary of the known and unknown cases under "Further questions".
   - Other minor changes to tighten the exposition.

2. Tightened the exposition throughout the paper.
   - Mostly minor changes to make the language less wordy.
   - Cut two different derivations for the ramification divisor of a scroll to one (after Proposition 4.3).
   - Relegated the result for eccentric threefold scrolls (Proposition 4.9) to a remark (Remark 4.9).
     The proof was a long explicit calculation, which we now omit.
   - Condensed the exposition of limit linear series by replacing exposition with references to Osserman's paper.

3. Cut Section 6 on the enumerative problem entirely, as advised by the referee.
   - The results are summarized in the introduction with short indication of how the proof works.
   - The longest part of the section was the case of the quartic surface scroll. It took us about 10 pages to obtain one degree. We now entirely omit this.

4. Updated the abstract.
